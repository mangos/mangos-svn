See the COPYING file for copying conditions.

== Installation Instructions ==
This documents describes the installation process for MaNGOS on Unix
platforms using the standard Makefile build process. This includes systems
like Fedora Core, Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, etc.

=== Configuring ===
MaNGOS uses the standard autoconf configure, thus all autoconf options
apply. In common we will assume that you do have a working C++ compiler on
your systems. If not, GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org/) is your friend.

There are several programs and libraries required in order to compile MaNGOS
successfully:

 * pthread development package (headers) are required, as MaNGOS uses
   threads. 
   Note: on some systems, the phtread development files are part of the
   glibc packages.
 * zthread development package (headers) are required, as MaNGOS uses
   threads.
 * zlib development package (headers) are required, as we use them for data
   compression.
 * MySQL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   this backend for storing all data.
 * OpenSSL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   them for authenticating the game client.

Optional packages to enhance the functionality of MaNGOS are:

 * Curses or termcap headers are not required but highly recommended because
   you'll get a much nicer console input/output.
 * LUA 5.1 development package (headers) are required to build the scripting
   library based on LUA.
 * Python 2.4 development package (headers) are required to build the Python
   scripting library. This will also require the included PyCXX package.

Here's a list of options that is specifically useful for configuring MaNGOS:

 --sysconfdir=/etc/mangos
   
   This will set the directory where the compiled daemons will look for the
   configuration files.

 --prefix=/home/your-username
   This will allow you to build and run MaNGOS and related tools from your
 --enable-debug
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information
   about what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you
   don't understand what happens.

Here's a sample sequence that configures MaNGOS for a debug build (this is
usually called cfg-debug.sh):

CFLAGS="-g -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-long-long" \
CXXFLAGS="-g -Wall -std=c++98 -Wno-long-long" \
LDFLAGS="-g" ./configure --sysconfdir=`pwd`/debug --enable-debug

if [ ! -d debug ]; then
	mkdir debug
	cp bin/*.conf debug/
	echo "Don't forget to modify the config files in debug/"
fi

To configure for production use it would be something like:

OPT="-s -O3 -ffast-math -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-long-long"
CFLAGS="$OPT" \
CXXFLAGS="$OPT -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-exceptions" \
LDFLAGS="-s" ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/mangos

I especially recommend the -fno-exceptions switch since the resulting
executable will be around 20% smaller and we don't use exceptions anyway.

=== Compiling ===
Well, it should be fairly simple if you got all the pre-requisites. Just
type

$ make

If you have a problem during compilation, we can't tell you what to do.
Figure it out yourself. If we would know in advance what problems you would
encounter, we would fix it in advance, or put a warning message in configure
at least.

Until this development branch will be merged into the trunk of our
SubVersion repository, no support will be provided.

Thank you for understanding.

=== Installing ===
Since there is nothing installable yet, there are no instructions available.

Makes sense, doesn't it?
